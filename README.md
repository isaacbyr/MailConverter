# MailConverter
A Txt to Mail Converter that I built with Python and Tkinter. This was the first time I worked with Tkinter, so it was exciting to be able to actually build a GUI. 
The program uses the stmp python library to help access the users email account and send the email. The program allows a user to pick a text file anywhere on the computer 
then input their email address and password, the recipents email address and the subject of the email. The program then takes the contents of the text file it read and 
writes it into the body of the email. The program only works being sent from outlook/hotmail or gmail addresses but can be sent to any email
